# Thesis template

This is a simple LaTeX template for a thesis based on the one that I made
for my own PhD thesis.

As per the requirements of the university two title pages are provided, one for
the cover and one for the first page after the cover.

It features chapter-wise bibliographies and a publication list in the end. 

The template splits all the different parts of the thesis into separate files
for easier version control.

The main title/cover block is set in the `title.tex` file  which is than
included in the `cover.tex` and `titlepage.tex` files to make sure that the same
author and title is present on both.
